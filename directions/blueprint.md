# DEPRECATED: Original Blueprint Document

**⚠️ NOTICE: This file has been superseded by structured AI specifications**

**For AI implementation, use:** `/ai-specs/ai-implementation-index.yml`

This original blueprint has been transformed into machine-optimized specifications located in the `/ai-specs/` directory. The new specifications provide:

- Enhanced structure for AI parsing
- Detailed component specifications
- Step-by-step implementation guides
- Comprehensive validation criteria
- Performance and accessibility requirements

**AI Agents should start with:** `/ai-specs/ai-implementation-index.yml`

**Original content archived at:** `directions/blueprint-original.md`

## Migration Information

The original blueprint content has been restructured into the following AI-optimized files:

- **`ai-specs/ai-implementation-index.yml`** - Main entry point for AI agents
- **`ai-specs/core-requirements.yml`** - Enhanced project requirements
- **`ai-specs/routes-specification.yml`** - Detailed page and component specs
- **`ai-specs/component-library.yml`** - Component implementation details
- **`ai-specs/firebase-configuration.yml`** - Backend and database configuration
- **`ai-specs/implementation-guide.yml`** - Step-by-step execution plan

## Quick Reference for AI Agents

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore + Auth + Functions + Storage)
- **CMS**: FireCMS for admin content management
- **Deployment**: Firebase Hosting with static export

### Brand Colors

- Primary: `#E44234` (Agency Red)
- Secondary: `#FF9A29` (Agency Orange)
- Accent: `#1679C0` (Agency Blue)

### Key Requirements

- Mobile-first responsive design (390px minimum)
- WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility compliance
- Performance targets: LCP <2.5s, CLS <0.1, FID <100ms
- Lighthouse scores: Performance ≥90, Accessibility ≥95, SEO ≥95

### Implementation Priority

1. **CRITICAL**: Project setup, Core components, Page implementation
2. **HIGH**: CMS integration, Deployment setup
3. **MEDIUM**: Cloud Functions, Styling optimization, Performance tuning
