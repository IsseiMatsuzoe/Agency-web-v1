# Agency Design System - Accessibility Principles
# AI Agent Reference: WCAG 2.2 compliance requirements

compliance-level: "WCAG 2.2 AA"
target-aaa: "Where feasible"

# Color & Contrast
color:
  contrast-ratios:
    normal-text: 4.5 # AA requirement
    large-text: 3.0 # AA requirement (18pt+ or 14pt+ bold)
    aaa-normal: 7.0 # AAA target
    aaa-large: 4.5 # AAA target

  accessibility-tests:
    - "Test all text/background combinations"
    - "Verify in grayscale"
    - "Check with color blindness simulators"

  color-dependence:
    rule: "Never use color alone to convey information"
    solutions: ["icons", "text labels", "patterns", "underlines"]

# Typography & Readability
typography:
  font-size:
    minimum: 16 # px for body text
    scalability: "Support 200% zoom without horizontal scroll"

  line-height:
    minimum: 1.5 # for body text
    headings: 1.3 # minimum for headings

  character-limits:
    max-line-length: 80 # characters for optimal reading

  font-choices:
    avoid: ["decorative fonts for body text", "low contrast fonts"]
    prefer: ["system fonts", "proven web fonts"]

# Interactive Elements
interactive:
  touch-targets:
    minimum-size: 44 # px (Apple/WCAG standard)
    spacing: 8 # px between targets

  keyboard-navigation:
    requirements:
      - "All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible"
      - "Logical tab order"
      - "Visible focus indicators"
      - "Skip links for main content"

  focus-indicators:
    style: "2px solid agency-blue"
    offset: 2 # px
    never-remove: true

# Content Structure
content:
  headings:
    hierarchy: "Use h1-h6 in logical order"
    skip-levels: false # Don't skip heading levels

  landmarks:
    required: ["main", "nav", "header", "footer"]
    regions: "Use ARIA landmarks for complex layouts"

  lists:
    usage: "Use proper list markup for related items"

  links:
    descriptive: "Link text must describe destination"
    avoid: ["click here", "read more", "learn more"]

# Images & Media
media:
  alt-text:
    decorative: 'alt=""' # Empty alt for decorative images
    informative: "Describe image function/content"
    complex: "Provide detailed description"

  icons:
    accessibility: "aria-label or sr-only text"
    decorative: 'aria-hidden="true"'

# Forms
forms:
  labels:
    requirement: "Every input must have a label"
    association: "Use for/id or aria-labelledby"

  error-handling:
    identification: "Clearly identify errors"
    description: "Explain how to fix errors"
    inline-validation: "Provide immediate feedback"

  required-fields:
    indication: "Mark required fields clearly"
    methods: ["asterisk + legend", "aria-required"]

# Motion & Animation
motion:
  respect-preferences: "prefers-reduced-motion: reduce"
  alternatives: "Provide static alternatives"

  safe-animations:
    duration: "≤300ms for UI feedback"
    parallax: "≤20px movement"

  avoid:
    - "Flashing content (>3 Hz)"
    - "Auto-playing videos with sound"
    - "Infinite scrolling without pause"

# Testing Requirements
testing:
  automated-tools:
    - "axe-core"
    - "WAVE"
    - "Lighthouse accessibility audit"

  manual-testing:
    - "Keyboard-only navigation"
    - "Screen reader testing (NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver)"
    - "High contrast mode"
    - "200% zoom test"

  user-testing:
    frequency: "Include users with disabilities in testing"

# AI Implementation Checklist
ai-checklist:
  always-include:
    - "semantic HTML structure"
    - "proper heading hierarchy"
    - "alt text for images"
    - "keyboard navigation support"
    - "focus management"
    - "color contrast verification"
    - "responsive text sizing"

  never-forget:
    - "aria-labels for icons"
    - "form field labels"
    - "error state descriptions"
    - "loading state announcements"

# Performance & Accessibility
performance:
  relationship: "Slow sites are inaccessible sites"
  targets:
    - "LCP <2.5s"
    - "CLS <0.1"
    - "FID <100ms"

# Emergency Accessibility Fixes

  - "Add alt text to images"
  - "Increase font sizes"
  - "Improve color contrast"
  - "Add focus indicators"
  - "Fix heading hierarchy"
  - "Label form inputs"
